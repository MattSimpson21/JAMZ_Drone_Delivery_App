# JAMZ_project_A2

Team Project Completed for the UOttawa Engineering Design Class GNG1103

Our team has designed a mobile based front-end application created in Javascript structure React Native for our client: JAMZ. The JAMZ company has created a drone operated delivery service and our application will connect users to this service and allow them to order food to their houses. 

Our design was created to be simple, functional, easy to use, and to have an appealing, minimalistic aesthetic. All of our code was written from the ground up by implementing react native modules, and it was designed to be easy to alter and customize. That is to say; all colors can be edited from a single page, and restaurant cards have been created using a custom self-populating template.
